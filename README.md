Personal Project on Data Science and Machine Learning
The project is an Inspiration From Neural Nine 
So I would do more EDA and Test Different Machine Learning algorithms each week on different subjects like employee attrition, satisfaction and different correlations
Use of Random Forest Classification

The Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble learning technique widely used in machine learning for classification and regression tasks.
It constructs multiple decision trees during the training phase and merges their outputs to enhance the model's accuracy and robustness

Project: Employee Attrition Prediction Model

This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using machine learning techniques. It demonstrates a data-driven approach to identifying key factors that influence employee turnover and implementing a predictive model based on those insights.

The analysis begins with a comprehensive data exploration phase where various attributes of employee data, such as demographics, job roles, income, and overtime, are inspected. Visualizations are used to uncover trends and relationships in the data.

The dataset is pre-processed by encoding categorical variables and handling missing data. Several attributes, such as gender, marital status, and business travel, are transformed into numerical features to fit into the models effectively.

A Decision Tree Classifier is utilized for the model, focusing on improving the results' accuracy and interpretability. The model is trained using key performance metrics like accuracy and the confusion matrix. The goal is to identify employees most likely to leave, helping HR departments implement strategies to retain them.

Key Features:

Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations.
Data cleaning and transformation (encoding categorical variables, handling missing data).
Decision Tree model for prediction, with evaluation metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
Focus on interpretability to identify the most important factors influencing employee attrition.
This project showcases the full lifecycle of a machine learning project from data exploration, feature engineering, and model training to evaluation, demonstrating skills relevant for data science and machine learning engineer positions.
